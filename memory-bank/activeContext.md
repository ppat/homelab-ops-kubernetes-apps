# Active Context

## Current State

- Repository providing reusable Kubernetes modules for GitOps-based deployment
- Modules designed for consumption by separate cluster configuration repositories
- Well-established module types (Infrastructure, Application, Component)
- Core/extra pattern implemented across multiple infrastructure modules
- Testing implemented through kyverno/chainsaw framework

## Active Initiatives

## Backlog Items

- Migration from flannel + metallb to cillium for CNI and load balancing
- Implementation of sensible default alerts across modules
- Development of comprehensive backup strategy
- Future security controls through kyverno

## Key Metrics

- Module deployment success rates
- Test coverage and validation metrics
- Documentation completeness
- Module reusability across clusters
