# Decision Log

## Interaction Protocol Decisions

### IP-1: Error Handling in AI Assistant Interactions
- **Decision**: Implement "3-strikes" rule for error handling in AI assistant operations
- **Context**: Need for efficient problem resolution in AI assistant interactions with user
- **Consequences**:
  - After 3 failed attempts at any operation (local commands, MCP usage, LLM API):
    * AI assistant will stop attempting further retries
    * Prompt user whether to continue trying different approaches
    * Ask for help if stuck
    * Avoid endless retry loops
  - More efficient problem resolution
  - Better user collaboration
  - Clear escalation path
  - This applies to all AI assistant interactions, not just this project

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Repository Purpose and Scope
- **Decision**: Repository to provide reusable modules rather than direct cluster deployments
- **Context**: Need for maintainable, reusable infrastructure components
- **Consequences**:
  - Modules can be used across different cluster configurations
  - Environment-specific configuration happens in separate repositories
  - Clear separation of module definition from usage
  - Better reusability and maintenance

### AD-2: Core/Extra Pattern Implementation
- **Decision**: Implement core/extra pattern across multiple infrastructure modules
- **Context**: Need to handle circular dependencies and complex deployment sequences
- **Consequences**:
  - Breaks circular dependencies in various modules (networking, observability, kubernetes, clusterops)
  - Enables gradual deployment
  - Clearer separation of essential vs additional features
  - More maintainable module structure

### AD-3: Storage Solution Architecture
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive storage solutions (block, object, NFS)
- **Context**: Need for diverse storage capabilities in kubernetes clusters
- **Consequences**:
  - Flexible storage options for different use cases
  - Support for various storage types
  - Integration with existing storage systems
  - More complex configuration requirements

### AD-4: Testing Framework Migration
- **Decision**: Migrate from GitHub Actions shell scripts to kyverno/chainsaw
- **Context**: Current testing limited to CI environment and lacks local capability
- **Consequences**:
  - Enables local testing during development
  - Better kubernetes context awareness
  - More structured testing approach
  - Initial migration effort required

## Implementation Decisions

### ID-1: Module Structure
- **Decision**: Strict separation of module definition from usage
- **Context**: Need for reusable, maintainable modules
- **Consequences**:
  - Clear module interfaces
  - Better version management
  - More documentation needed
  - Additional integration effort

### ID-2: Configuration Methods
- **Decision**: Support multiple configuration methods (Kustomize, FluxCD, Components)
- **Context**: Different configuration needs require different approaches
- **Consequences**:
  - More flexible configuration options
  - Clear configuration hierarchy
  - Need to document when to use each method
  - More complex configuration management

### ID-3: Documentation Priority
- **Decision**: Prioritize comprehensive documentation
- **Context**: Need for clear module and repository documentation
- **Consequences**:
  - Better module usability
  - Clearer integration paths
  - More maintenance overhead
  - Initial development slowdown

## Future Considerations

### FC-1: Testing Enhancement
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Context**: Moving to kyverno/chainsaw framework
- **Options**:
  - Complete framework migration
  - Hybrid approach during transition
  - Enhanced test coverage
  - Local testing support

### FC-2: Infrastructure Evolution
- **Status**: Planned
- **Context**: Various infrastructure improvements needed
- **Options**:
  - Migration to cillium
  - Default alert implementation
  - Backup strategy development
  - Security controls through kyverno
