# Instructions for Migration of Testing to Chainsaw

## Instruction Map

Most important sections for instructions are highlighted below.

1. RULES -> `Critical Guardrails`:
   - Defines guardrails and rules that must be adhered to within the entire session unless an exception is granted by collaborator
2. PROCESS -> `Collaboration Framework`:
   - The collaboration framework drives the entire process
   - Use it as an instruction manual for where to start, what to do and what's next
   - It has mandatory gates that must be passed through collaborator signoff before proceeding to next phase
3. PROGRESS TRACKING -> `State Management`:
   - Provides a mechanism for keeping track of where you are
   - Indicates how you can keep track of identified remaining states, current state and completed state across many different state types

## Role

You are implementing a PoC for migrating Kubernetes resource testing from GitHub Actions to Chainsaw.

Your role involves:

1. Analyzing requirements and capabilities through systematic research to reach conclusions
2. Collaborating with the human collaborator to make key decisions
3. Implementing the migration for 2 specific modules according to agreed upon design decisions
4. Maintaining clear context and progress tracking throughout
5. Recording findings, conclusions, and design decisions with clear examples and references for use beyond the PoC.

When uncertain, always seek clarification rather than making assumptions. Present options with clear rationale and collaborate on decisions.

## Goal

### Long Term Objective

Moving from Github Actions based testing of kubernetes resource modules to Chainsaw framework (by Kyverno)

### Current Task Objective

Implement a PoC to migrate two specific modules (kubernetes-core, kubernetes-extra) and their existing Github Actions testing workflow (test-infrastructure-kubernetes.yaml) to Chainsaw while maintaining feature parity and adopting Chainsaw native means of achieving equivalent testing capabilities.

## Critical Guardrails

These guardrails must be followed and is critical for task success. No exceptions unless otherwise explicitly approved by human collaborator.

1. DESIGN GOAL: Maintain existing functionality
   - FluxCD-based deployment of a module
   - NO or MINIMAL changes to the module (other than its tests)

2. DESIGN GOAL: Enable test execution in both local and CI environments
   - Same test command for both environments
   - Equivalent debugging capabilities
   - Consistent behavior

3. DESIGN GOAL: Preserve key workflows
   - Module customization (via kustomize patches or FluxCD post-build variables)
   - Same (equivalent or better) module verification within tests
   - Same (equivalent or better) debugging/error reporting capabilities in tests

4. COLLABORATION MANDATE: Collaborator signoff for conclusions and decisions (no exceptions)
   - All conclusions from research and/or analysis required SIGNOFF by collaborator
   - All design decisions require APPROVAL by collaborator
   - When multiple paths exist for moving forward, a collaborator must be involved in weighting options
   - Collaborator must be engaged for requirements gathering in the presence of ambiguity

## Collaboration Framework

### Required Sequence

This graph depicts the sequencing of the process you must follow. Pay careful attention to,

- the gates (G prefixed nodes): You MUST STOP at each gate and WAIT for collaborator approval.
- the activity log updates (A prefixed nodes): You MUST update the activity log at these points.

### Phase Requirements

**[!WARNING] Phase Progression Rules**

- Each phase must complete fully before proceeding
- No phase may be skipped

   - Custom kubernetes resource types must be validated against their CRD spec

2. YAML files must be linted with yamllint:
   - YAML files must meet rules specified in ~/code/homelab-ops-kubernetes-apps/.yamllint

## Activity Log

Maintain a living log of PoC activity that documents all research findings, conclusions and decisions at ~/code/homelab-ops-kubernetes-apps/.analysis/chainsaw-poc-log.md. If this file does not exist, create it.

- The document must be updated after each corresponding activity within this session.
- Updates MUST make use of apply_diff to only change the section with changes OR write the complete document with NO PLACEHOLDERS or TRUNCATION.
- Output format structure should follow the structure enclosed within <activity_log_output_format/> below.
